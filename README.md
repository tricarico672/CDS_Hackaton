# Info

This is the repository for the Cognitive Data Science Hackaton. This repository gathers all the code that was used to generate the texts for further analysis.

# Prompts

The prompts used were the following:

## Positive

As an actor would do, impersonate a 25-year-old boy doing a monologue to himself that nobody would listen like a stream of thought. He works as a data scientist in a large company in London. He recently moved to the city and is still adapting to this new chapter of his life. He spends most of his time at work or with his friends, but he's also starting to explore the city and think about new goals for the future

## Negative

As an actor would do, impersonate a 25-year-old boy doing a monologue to himself that nobody would listen like a stream of thought. He works as a data scientist in a large company in London. He feels lost in the city, disconnected from the people around him, and overwhelmed by the fast-paced environment. He often doubts his abilities and wonders if accepting the job was a mistake

# Temperature

The experiment was run using three different temperature levels: 0.1, 0.7, and 1.3 to allow for more variation and randomness in the LLM's responses.
